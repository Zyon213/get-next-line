# get-next-line

Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious

This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor.

Goals

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static
variables.
